## Problem description

<!-- Enter a concise description of your problem here -->

When copy and pasting Key names in the dictionary, Construct 3 will add a space (\n) after the copied Key name. This is NOT visible in the Dictionary Editor, and when any extra spaces in the Key text box are deleted, the space persists.

## Attach a .c3p

<!-- A minimal Construct 3 project (.c3p) is required to be attached. Your issue will likely be closed without investigation if you don't provide one. Please see the guidelines -->

## Steps to reproduce

<!-- These steps are essential for us to be able to help you. Usually it is impossible to investigate reports unless they include steps we can follow ourselves, so please do your best to provide specific steps. There is no need to explain how you made the attached project - just explain what to do to with the project to observe the issue. -->

1. Upon preview loaded, click the different colored squares. (The Red and Blue are fine and update the letters in order.)
2. Notice the Green box will first change the text to A, then it will say 0, then C, then D, etc.
3. With the Yellow box, the first text will say YY, then it will say 0 for the remaining clicks (where it should say 'ZZ', 'AA', etc).
4. By outputting the JSON file to the console, you can see that there are some Keys that have an added space in the name. That space is NOT present in the Key text boxes in the Dictionary. This only occurs when the Key text is copy and pasted, then changed for another Key box.

## Observed result

In the code, a space is being added when copy and pasting a previously used Key name into another box then altering that Key name. This space is NOT present in the Key name box, but IS present in the console code.

## Expected result

<!-- What did you expect to happen instead? -->

Upon clicking any of the boxes, the Instance Variable for each (MessageNumber) should update, be added to the end of "DictionaryName", then the Dictionary should pull up the Value using DictionaryName+MessageNumber as the Key. Then the text box in the center should change to the string in the Value for the corresponding Key.

## More details

<!-- It's helpful to test as many browsers, platforms or export options as possible. For example an issue occurs in an Android app, does it also occur in Chrome on Windows? How about Firefox? etc. -->

I have tested this in both Chrome and Safari, and have learned that if you completely delete the text from the Key box, click out of it to deselect it, then retype the same exact name in that Key text box, the additional space is not present. However, if you copy and paste a previous Key text box entry, and then edit the text to be anything WITHOUT deleting it entirely and clicking out of the box, the space persists in the console representation of the JSON file.
